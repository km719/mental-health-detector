## Ensemble NLP for Mental Health Warning Sign Detection

Mental health is a serious issue that affects millions of people each year. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), more than one in five adults in the US have a mental illness (57.8 million in 2021). It is even more prevalent in young adults aged 18-25 with a rate of 33.7%, who are the primary demographic who post and comment on social media. Our project uses multiple datasets to try and classify messages which may be indicative of several types of mental illnesses. On top of this, it has the purpose of being able to identify which words in the message in question were the major signals that something could be wrong. Our hope is that we can use NLP to try and identify early if someone may have a mental illness so that they can get help before it worsens; the main purpose of this system would be a ”Red Flag Detector” that would alert mental health providers to members of their community who may need treatment.
